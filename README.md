# Amazon_Vine_Analysis
## Overview
The purpose of this project is to analyze Amazon reviews written by members of the paid Amazon Vine program for videogames. This program is a service that allows manufacturers and publishers to receive reviews on their products and get a sense of the consumer sentiment, as users are required to leave a review.
## Results
There were a total of 37,475 reviews that fit the criteria of being helpful. From this total reviews the following analysis was done:
- The total number of the vine program reviews were only 90 vs the total number of review not a part of the vine program that was 37,385 as shown in the databases below:

- Out of the total reviews we also determined that 44 reviews were 5-star reviews from the paid vine program vs 14,626 5 star reviews that were from the unpaid vine program as shown below:

- The percentagge of vine reviews that were 5 star is 48.9% vs the percentage of non-vine 5 star reviews which was 39% as seen below.

## Summary
Based on the dataset that we are analyzing there does not seem to be a bias with the vine program since the 5-star reviews are below the 50% mark at 48.9%. If this number was above 50% there would be a clear bias that the majority of the members of the program had a positive bias. However, one thing to consider is this is a very small number of reviews compared to the non-vine program users and with the percentage of non-vine program 5 star reviews 39% it is a better indication of the consumer sentiment as the pool of reviews to compare to is much higher here. One way to get a better understanding of the bias, is to do an analysis on the 1 star reviews and see if there is any negative bias. But ultimately, to get a better understanding we would need more members in the program or to consider both 5 star and 4 star reviews as an indicator.
